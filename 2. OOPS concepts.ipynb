    "Inheritance is the capability of one class to derive or inherit the properties from another class. The class that derives properties is called the derived class or child class and the class from which the properties are being derived is called the base class or parent class. The benefits of inheritance are:\n",

    "1. It represents real-world relationships well.\n",
    "2. It provides the reusability of a code. We donâ€™t have to write the same code again and again. Also, it allows us to add more features to a class without modifying it.\n",

    "3. Hierarchical Inheritance: Hierarchical-level inheritance enables more than one derived class to inherit properties from a parent class.\n",
    "4. Multiple Inheritance: Multiple-level inheritance enables one derived class to inherit properties from more than one base class."

In Python, *polymorphism* refers to the way in which different object classes can share the same method name, and those methods can be called from the same place even though a variety of different objects might be passed in. The best way to explain this is by example:"
